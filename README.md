# MultidimArrays
Simple multi-dimensional arrays in c++

The aim of this simple header library is to provide a templated class to manage multi dimensional arrays.

A multi-dimensional array can be built to manage its own memory or to serve as a view to a specific portion of memory.

Move semantics is supported.

The library is still under devellopement, I should add other options when I need them, especially memory alignement constraints.
